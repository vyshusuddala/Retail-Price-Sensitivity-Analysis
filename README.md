# Retail-Price-Sensitivity-Analysis
A data analytics project that evaluates how price variations affect retail demand using Excel, Python, regression modeling, and data visualization.

This project focuses on data analysis and visualization using Python to solve two real-world business problems:

Retail Price Sensitivity Analysis – Understanding how product price affects sales quantity.

Job Salary Data Analysis – Analyzing salary trends across job roles and experience levels.

The project demonstrates end-to-end data handling, from Excel data creation to statistical analysis and visualization using Python libraries.

Objectives

Analyze the relationship between price and quantity sold in a retail scenario

Identify price sensitivity using exploratory data analysis

Compare average salaries across different job roles

Study how experience impacts salary growth

Visualize insights clearly for business decision-making

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Statsmodels – Regression analysis

MS Excel – Data input/output

Google Colab – Execution environment

Dataset Details

Quantity_Sold: Units sold at each price

Job Salary Dataset

Role: Job designation

Experience: Years of experience (0 indicates fresher)

Salary: Annual salary in LPA

Key Analysis Performed
Retail Price Sensitivity

Created and loaded data using Excel

Cleaned and prepared data

Visualized Price vs Quantity Sold using scatter plots

Observed inverse relationship between price and demand

Job Salary Analysis

Calculated average salary by job role

Visualized salary distribution using bar charts and box plots

Analyzed experience vs salary growth using scatter plots

Included fresher-level (0 experience) salary insights

Visualizations Included

Scatter plots (Price vs Quantity, Experience vs Salary)

Bar charts (Average Salary by Role)

Box plots (Salary distribution by Role)

Key Insights

Higher prices lead to lower sales quantity, indicating strong price sensitivity

Data Scientists show the highest salary growth with experience

Freshers’ salaries vary significantly by role

Experience plays a major role in salary increments across all roles
